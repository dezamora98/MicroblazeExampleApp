Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,621 out of  29,504    5%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,475 out of  29,504    8%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,682 out of  14,752   11%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,682 out of   1,682 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,682   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,640 out of  29,504    8%
    Number used as logic:             2,089
    Number used as a route-thru:        165
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     256
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     130

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 23 out of     250    9%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       5
  Number of RAMB16s:                     17 out of      36   47%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       8   12%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                3 out of      36    8%
