Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,546 out of  29,504    5%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,451 out of  29,504    8%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,871 out of  14,752   12%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,871 out of   1,871 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,871   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,613 out of  29,504    8%
    Number used as logic:             2,084
    Number used as a route-thru:        162
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     256
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     111

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 21 out of     250    8%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       4
  Number of RAMB16s:                     17 out of      36   47%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       8   12%
